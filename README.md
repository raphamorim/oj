# oj

0. If you like the idea and project please consider sponsor, working on it in my free time.
1. This is a research project, use on your own risk.
2. It was created out of frustration with agents running vite build when I was working on rioterm-js repository. Each build process was carrying 2gb.
3. Working on it mostly to fix my own problems.

OJ is a Rust-native build tool for React apps.

It optimizes for memory and cold start, where running many builds (CI, agents, multi-tenant) under Vite gets expensive. OJ is meant to run real production React apps without changes to their source.

This project is alpha, so expect bugs. For real.

## Server rendering

There is an SSR mode: `oj dev --ssr src/entry-server.tsx` in dev, and `oj build --ssr` for production. It streams the HTML out with `renderToReadableStream` instead of buffering, and the client hydrates through
the normal dev pipeline, so Fast Refresh and HMR keep working over a server-rendered page.

In dev the server modules run in a small persistent Node process (a module runner using `vm.SourceTextModule`) that re-evaluates only what changed, instead of rebuilding a bundle per request.

## Plugins

Vite/Rollup-style plugins run through a persistent Node plugin host. Drop an `oj.plugins.mjs` at the app root that default-exports a plugin array, or let oj read an app's `vite.config.{ts,js,mjs}` and pick up its `plugins` array directly.

A TypeScript config (including one that imports local `.ts` files) is loaded via Vite's own config loader when Vite is installed, or bundled with the app's esbuild otherwise. From a `vite.config` oj also adopts the app's `base`, `server.port`/`host`, `define`, and `resolve.alias` for any field its own config
leaves unset, alias entries resolve alongside tsconfig `paths`, in both `oj dev` and `oj build`.

## TanStack Start

Point oj at a TanStack Start app and it runs the framework directly, no source changes. It detects Start from the app itself:

```sh
oj dev web                                       # dev server for the ./web Start app
oj build web                                     # production build
```

Dev serves file-based routes with streaming SSR and client hydration, keeps Fast Refresh working, runs server functions in the module runner, and applies the app's `vite.config` plugins (React and the app's own). `oj build` emits a Node `server.mjs`, a Cloudflare `worker.mjs` (`nodejs_compat`), content-hashed client assets, and prerendered routes. oj's own docs site (`www/`) is a TanStack Start app built by oj and served from a Cloudflare Worker.

## Quickstart

Install the CLI from crates.io, then run `oj` in any app:

```sh
cargo install oj                                # install the `oj` CLI
oj dev                                           # dev server for the current app on :5199
oj build                                         # production build into ./dist
```

## Benchmarks

Generated fanout-10 React component trees, measured save-to-paint with Playwright against Vite 8.2.1 (Rolldown-based) on an M-series Mac, in both its default dev mode (vite) and its experimental bundled dev mode (vite-fbm). p50/p95 over 5 cold+warm restart cycles and 10 HMR edits.

**1,000 components (p50/p95):**

**10,000 components (p50/p95):**

| tool | cold start | warm start | reload | HMR | server RSS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **oj --bundle** | **1315/1333ms** | **1129/1442ms** | **232/237ms** | **67/72ms** | **115MB** |
| oj (unbundled) | 2492/2543ms | 2068/2303ms | 1523/1687ms | 67/176ms | 94MB |
| vite | 5693/6085ms | 5304/6289ms | 1781/1820ms | 59/64ms | 1552MB |
| vite-fbm | 1528/2225ms | 1482/2176ms | 302/414ms | 59/65ms | 1751MB |

Bundle-mode oj wins cold start, warm start, and reload against Vite's default dev at every size (4-8x at 10k), and now also beats Vite's experimental bundled dev on all three at every size (cold, warm, and reload). HMR is a wash across all four (within ~10ms). oj's decisive, consistent win is memory: 43-115MB against Vite's 361MB-1.75GB, an 8-15x gap that widens with app size.

Production builds (`oj build` vs `vite build`) land at parity: same engine (Rolldown), byte-identical output sizes.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace                            # unit + integration suites
node e2e/run.mjs                                  # the end-to-end suite
```

The suite is organized by failure mode rather than by module -- adversarial
input, boundary shapes, contention, injected faults, and properties that hold
for every input -- and `docs/development/testing.md` describes the layers, the
fuzz targets, and the behaviours that are deliberate boundaries rather than
gaps.
